Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

Driverpass is a company trying to cease an oppurtunity they see in drivers education market. Based on the research the company has done, they found that the majority of students who take their driving test fail it on their first try. Driver pass's goal is to build a system for students and faculty to log into to access training material and manage user accounts. 

What did you do particularly well?

In this assignment, I felt that my program diagrams were done particularly well. I thought they accurately represented the overall theme of the project, and would be easy to follow in a true development environment. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I have already done this. As stated in the previous questions, I feel as though the design diagrams that I created for this project are a good representation of the project as a whole. However, prior to the final submission of the project, I was not at all happy with these diagrams and so I re-created them upon submitting this assignment. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interepreted the user needs for this project through a transcipt of the orignal system design meeting that was created for the project. I was able to read through this and accurately describe the system requirements and create design documents. User needs for a system is a crucial step to the success of a project. Without having the system requirements clearly defined in the scope of a project, there can really be no way of objectively deciding whether the project is a success or not. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software for personal projects, I typically take a more fundamental approach. I take a step back and think about what it is that my program is trying to accomplish. Then, I will right out the steps that it takes to get there functionally. After that, I will create a UML diagram to lay out the classes/functions that I will need to make the system function the intended way. When this is complete, I will start working on the program one step at a time, complete each function one by one and ensuring that they are error free and function individually before integrating them together to complete the project.
